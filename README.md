# Murine-Lung-macrophages-RNAseq
##Overview
This project processes gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset exploring three different phenotypes of murine lung interstial macrophages, performs differential expression analysis.
##Key features:

Differential expression analysis between alveolar and interstial macrophage 

##Data
This repository includes:
